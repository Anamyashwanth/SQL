# 📘 DML Introduction

## Data Manipulation Language – SQL Server (SSMS)

---

## 1️⃣ What is DML?

**DML (Data Manipulation Language)** is a set of SQL commands used to **manipulate data stored inside database tables**.

👉 DML works on **rows (records)**, not on table structure.

> If **DDL builds the table**,
> **DML works with the data inside the table**.

---

## 2️⃣ Purpose of DML

DML is used to:

* Insert new records into tables
* Modify existing records
* Remove unwanted records
* Maintain and manage business data

Without DML, a database would only have **empty tables**.

## 3️⃣ DML Commands in SQL Server

| Command | Purpose                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------- |
| INSERT  | Add new rows                      |
| UPDATE  | Modify existing rows              |
| DELETE  | Remove rows                       |
| MERGE   | Insert / Update / Delete together |

These commands are **executed frequently in real-time applications**.

---

## 4️⃣ Position of DML in SQL Workflow

Typical SQL workflow:

1. **DDL** – Create structure
2. **DML** – Manipulate data
3. **DQL** – Retrieve data (`SELECT`)
4. **TCL** – Control transactions
5. **DCL** – Manage permissions

👉 DML comes **after DDL** and **before reporting**.

## 5️⃣ Characteristics of DML

| Feature           | Description               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Works on          | Data (rows)               |
| Affects structure | ❌ No                      |
| Transactional     | ✅ Yes                     |
| Rollback possible | ✅ Yes                     |
| WHERE clause      | Important                 |
| Data safety       | Medium (depends on usage) |

---

## 6️⃣ DML and Transactions

DML commands support **transactions**, which means:

* Changes can be **committed**
* Changes can be **rolled back**
* Multiple DML statements can be grouped together

Example (conceptual):

```sql
BEGIN TRAN;
INSERT ...
UPDATE ...
ROLLBACK;
```

👉 This makes DML **safer than DDL**.

---

## 7️⃣ DML vs DDL (Core Difference)

| DML                    | DDL                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Works on data          | Works on structure    |
| INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | CREATE, ALTER, DROP   |
| Transactional          | Auto-commit           |
| Rollback possible      | Rollback not possible |

---

## 8️⃣ Importance of WHERE Clause in DML

* UPDATE and DELETE **should always use WHERE**
* Missing WHERE can affect **all rows**
* Most production issues occur due to **missing WHERE clause**

⚠️ This is one of the **most common SQL mistakes**.

---

## 9️⃣ Real-Time Usage of DML

DML is used in:

* Web & mobile applications
* Banking transactions
* Employee management systems
* E-commerce platforms
* Reporting and analytics systems

👉 Every user action usually triggers a DML operation.

---

## 🔟 Common DML Mistakes

* Forgetting WHERE clause
* Not using transactions
* Running DML directly on production
* Updating wrong records
* Not validating data before insert
