# 📘 DROP Command – SQL Server (SSMS)

---

## 1️⃣ What is DROP Command?

The **`DROP` command** is a **DDL (Data Definition Language)** statement used to **permanently remove database objects** from SQL Server.

> DROP deletes the **object definition + its data**.

---

## 2️⃣ Why DROP Command is Used?

DROP is used when:

* An object is no longer required
* Old / unused tables exist
* Cleaning test or temporary databases
* Replacing objects with new design
* Removing incorrect objects

⚠️ DROP is **destructive** and **cannot be undone**.

## 1️⃣6️⃣ Important Characteristics of DROP

| Point            | Explanation    |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Command Type     | DDL            |
| Auto Commit      | Yes            |
| Rollback         | ❌ Not possible |
| Data Loss        | Permanent      |
| Dependency Check | Required       |

---

## 1️⃣7️⃣ Common DROP Errors

* Object does not exist
* Object is referenced by another object

---

## 1️⃣8️⃣ DROP vs DELETE vs TRUNCATE

| DROP           | DELETE         | TRUNCATE       |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Removes object | Removes rows   | Removes rows   |
| Structure lost | Structure kept | Structure kept |
| Fast           | Slow           | Fast           |
| Auto commit    | Transactional  | Auto commit    |

---

## 1️⃣9️⃣ ALTER vs DROP (Quick Compare)

| ALTER           | DROP           |
