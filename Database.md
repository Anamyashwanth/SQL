# Database

A database is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system and usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.
Data is statically raw and unprocessed information.
**Application:** Company Information, Account information, manufacturing, banking, finance transactions, telecommunications.
In a database, data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns and it is indexed so data can be updated, expanded, and deleted easily. Computer databases typically contain file records data like transactions money in one bank account to another bank account, sales and customer details, fee details of students, and product details. There are different kinds of databases, ranging from the most prevalent approach, the relational database, to a distributed database, cloud database, and NoSQL databases.  

**Relational Database**: A relational database is made up of a set of tables with data that fits into a predefined category.
**Distributed Database**: A distributed database is a database in which portions of the database are stored in multiple physical locations, and in which processing is dispersed or replicated among different points in a network. 
**Cloud Database**: A cloud database is a database that typically runs on a cloud computing platform. Database service provides access to the database. Database services make the underlying software stack transparent to the user.

## Types of Databases
There are many types of databases.

**Relational Databases:** A relational databaseâ€™s contents are arranged as a collection of tables with rows and columns. Accessing structured data is made most flexible and efficient by relational database technology.
**Object-Oriented Databases:** Similar to object-oriented programming, data in an object-oriented database is represented as objects.
**Distributed Databases:** A distributed database is made up of two or more files that are spread across multiple locations. The database could be dispersed across many networks, housed in one physical place, or kept on several computers.
**Data Warehouses:** A data warehouse is a sort of database created especially for quick query and analysis. It is a central repository for data.
**NoSQL Databases:** Unlike relational databases, which specify how all data input must be formatted, NoSQL, or nonrelational databases, permit the storing and manipulation of unstructured and semistructured data. The prevalence and complexity of online applications led to the rise in popularity of NoSQL databases.
**Graph Databases:** Data is stored in a graph database using entities and their relationships.
**OLTP Database:** An OLTP database is a quick, analytical database made to handle lots of transactions from several users at once.
**Open source databases:** A database system that is open source can have either a SQL or NoSQL database as its source code.
**Cloud databases:** A collection of organized or unorganized data that is housed on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform is known as a cloud database. Cloud database models come in two flavors: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS, a service provider handles maintenance and administrative duties
