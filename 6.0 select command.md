# SELECT COMMAND
---

## 1. What is SELECT command?

The SELECT command is used to **retrieve data from database tables**.

* It belongs to **DQL (Data Query Language)**
* It is a **read-only command**
* It does not modify table data
* It does not change table structure

SELECT is the **most frequently used SQL command**.

---

## 2. Why SELECT command is important?

SELECT command is used to:

* View data stored in tables
* Validate INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
* Generate reports
* Perform data analysis
* Feed data to reporting and BI tools (Power BI, SSRS)

Without SELECT, data exists but **cannot be viewed or analyzed**.

## 3. Category of SELECT command

| Command | Category |
| ------- | -------- |
| SELECT  | DQL      |
| INSERT  | DML      |
| UPDATE  | DML      |
| DELETE  | DML      |
| CREATE  | DDL      |

## 4. Basic SELECT syntax

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table_name;
```

---

## 5. Selecting all columns

```sql
SELECT *
FROM tbl_emp;
```

Explanation:

* `*` represents all columns
* SQL Server retrieves every column for each row
* Simple to write but **not recommended in real projects**
* Fetches unnecessary data and affects performance

---

## 6. Selecting specific columns (recommended)

```sql
SELECT eid, name, salary
FROM tbl_emp;
```

Advantages:

* Faster query execution
* Reduced memory usage
* Cleaner output
* Better performance in large tables

---

## 7. Column alias in SELECT

```sql
SELECT eid AS EmployeeID,
       name AS EmployeeName,
       salary AS MonthlySalary
FROM tbl_emp;
```

Explanation:

* Alias gives a temporary name to a column
* `AS` keyword is optional
* Alias exists only in result set
* Useful for reports and readability

---

## 8. Table alias in SELECT

```sql
SELECT e.eid, e.name, e.salary
FROM tbl_emp e;
```

Explanation:

* Table alias shortens query
* Improves readability
* Mandatory when working with joins or self-joins

---

## 9. SELECT with expressions

```sql
SELECT name, salary * 12 AS AnnualSalary
FROM tbl_emp;
```

Explanation:

* Expression is calculated at runtime
* Does not update the actual table data
* Used for calculations and derived values

---

## 10. SELECT with literal (constant) values

```sql
SELECT 'SQL Server' AS DatabaseName;
```

Explanation:

* Returns constant values
* No table required
* Commonly used in testing and reports

---

## 11. SELECT without FROM clause

```sql
SELECT GETDATE() AS CurrentDate;
```

Explanation:

* SQL Server allows SELECT without FROM
* Used with system functions
* Returns server current date and time

---

## 12. SELECT DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT dept
FROM tbl_emp;
```

Explanation:

* Removes duplicate values from result set
* DISTINCT works on entire row
* Applied before ORDER BY
* Slight performance cost on large datasets

---

## 13. SELECT TOP clause

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 *
FROM tbl_emp;
```

Explanation:

* Returns first N rows
* Result is unpredictable without ORDER BY
* SQL Server specific feature

---

## 14. TOP WITH TIES

```sql
SELECT TOP 3 WITH TIES *
FROM tbl_emp
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

Explanation:

* Returns extra rows if values match the last row
* Useful in ranking scenarios
* Common interview question

---

## 15. SELECT with OFFSET–FETCH (Pagination)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM tbl_emp
ORDER BY eid
OFFSET 5 ROWS
FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

Explanation:

* Used for page-wise data retrieval
* OFFSET skips rows
* FETCH limits rows
* Available from SQL Server 2012 onwards
* ORDER BY is mandatory

---

## 16. SELECT with WHERE (overview)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM tbl_emp
WHERE dept = 'IT';
```

Explanation:

* WHERE filters rows
* Applied before GROUP BY
* Reduces number of rows processed
* Deep dive covered separately

---

## 17. SELECT with ORDER BY (overview)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM tbl_emp
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

Explanation:

* Sorts result set
* Sorting is temporary
* Default order is ASC

---

## 18. SELECT with GROUP BY (overview)

```sql
SELECT dept, SUM(salary)
FROM tbl_emp
GROUP BY dept;
```

Explanation:

* Groups rows with same values
* Used with aggregate functions
* Returns one row per group

---

## 19. Logical execution order of SELECT

Although written as:

```sql
SELECT
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
```

SQL Server executes logically in this order:

1. FROM
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. SELECT
6. ORDER BY
7. OFFSET / FETCH

Understanding this is **very important for interviews**.

---

## 20. SELECT and performance considerations

* Avoid using `SELECT *`
* Always filter rows using WHERE
* Select only required columns
* Use indexes on filtered and sorted columns
* Use TOP or OFFSET for large datasets

---

## 21. Common SELECT mistakes

* Assuming table data is stored in sorted order
* Using SELECT * in production
* Forgetting ORDER BY
* Mixing aggregated and non-aggregated columns
* Ignoring NULL handling

---

## 22. One-line exam / interview memory

SELECT command is used to retrieve data from database tables without modifying the data.
