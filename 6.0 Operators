# 📘 OPERATORS Chapter

## SQL Server (SSMS)

---

## 1️⃣ What are Operators in SQL?

**Operators** are **symbols or keywords** used to **perform operations on data values** in SQL statements.

👉 Operators help SQL:

* Compare values
* Perform calculations
* Combine conditions
* Work with ranges and strings

> Operators are used **inside SQL commands**, especially with `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

---

## 2️⃣ Why Operators are Important?

Operators are important because:

* SQL must make decisions (true / false)
* Filtering data requires comparisons
* Calculations are required in reports
* Business rules depend on conditions

👉 **Without operators, SQL cannot process logic.**

---

## 3️⃣ Categories of Operators in SQL Server

SQL Server operators are broadly classified into:

| Category             | Purpose                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Arithmetic Operators | Perform mathematical operations |
| Comparison Operators | Compare two values              |
| Logical Operators    | Combine conditions              |
| Assignment Operators | Assign or modify values         |
| Range Operators      | Work with ranges and lists      |
| String Operators     | Work with text data             |

---

# 🔹 1. Arithmetic Operators

## 4️⃣ What are Arithmetic Operators?

Arithmetic operators perform **mathematical calculations**.

---

### Operators List

| Operator | Meaning             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| `+`      | Addition            |
| `-`      | Subtraction         |
| `*`      | Multiplication      |
| `/`      | Division            |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder) |

---

### Example

```sql
SELECT 20 + 5 AS AddResult,
       20 - 5 AS SubResult,
       20 * 5 AS MulResult,
       20 / 5 AS DivResult,
       20 % 3 AS ModResult;
GO
```

### Explanation

* Calculations happen at runtime
* No table data is modified

---

# 🔹 2. Comparison Operators

## 5️⃣ What are Comparison Operators?

Comparison operators are used to **compare two values** and return TRUE or FALSE.

---

### Operators List

| Operator    | Meaning               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| `=`         | Equal to              |
| `!=` / `<>` | Not equal to          |
| `>`         | Greater than          |
| `<`         | Less than             |
| `>=`        | Greater than or equal |
| `<=`        | Less than or equal    |

---

### Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE Marks >= 75;
GO
```

---

# 🔹 3. Logical Operators

## 6️⃣ What are Logical Operators?

Logical operators are used to **combine multiple conditions**.

---

### Operators List

| Operator | Meaning                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| AND      | All conditions must be true    |
| OR       | Any one condition must be true |
| NOT      | Negates a condition            |

---

### Example (AND)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE Marks >= 70 AND Marks <= 90;
GO
```

---

### Example (OR)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE Marks < 40 OR Marks > 90;
GO
```

---

### Example (NOT)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE NOT Marks < 60;
GO
```

---

# 🔹 4. Assignment Operators

## 7️⃣ What are Assignment Operators?

Assignment operators are used **mainly in UPDATE statements** to assign or modify values.

---

### Operators List

| Operator | Meaning             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| `=`      | Assign value        |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   |

---

### Example

```sql
UPDATE Students
SET Marks += 5;
GO
```

### Explanation

* Adds 5 to Marks for all rows
* Equivalent to `Marks = Marks + 5`

---

# 🔹 5. Range Operators

## 8️⃣ What are Range Operators?

Range operators check whether a value lies **within a range or a set of values**.

---

### Operators List

| Operator    | Purpose                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| BETWEEN     | Value within a range    |
| NOT BETWEEN | Value outside range     |
| IN          | Match any value in list |
| NOT IN      | Exclude list values     |

---

### BETWEEN Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE Marks BETWEEN 60 AND 80;
GO
```

✔ Both limits are **inclusive**

---

### IN Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE StudentID IN (1, 3, 5);
GO
```

---

### NOT IN Warning

```sql
-- Dangerous if NULL exists
WHERE StudentID NOT IN (1, 2, NULL);
```

📌 NOT IN fails if list contains NULL.

---

# 🔹 6. String Operators

## 9️⃣ What are String Operators?

String operators work with **text (character) data**.

---

### String Operators List

| Operator | Purpose             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| `+`      | Concatenate strings |
| LIKE     | Pattern matching    |
| NOT LIKE | Exclude pattern     |

---

### String Concatenation Example

```sql
SELECT StudentName + ' scored ' + CAST(Marks AS VARCHAR)
FROM Students;
GO
```

---

### LIKE Operator (Pattern Matching)

| Pattern | Meaning                  |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| `%`     | Any number of characters |
| `_`     | Exactly one character    |

---

### LIKE Examples

```sql
-- Starts with A
WHERE StudentName LIKE 'A%';

-- Ends with n
WHERE StudentName LIKE '%n';

-- Contains ash
WHERE StudentName LIKE '%ash%';
```

---

# 🔹 7. Operator Precedence

## 🔟 What is Operator Precedence?

Operator precedence defines **which operator is evaluated first**.

### Order (High → Low)

1. `*`, `/`, `%`
2. `+`, `-`
3. Comparison operators
4. NOT
5. AND
6. OR

---

### Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE Marks > 60 AND Marks < 90 OR StudentID = 1;
GO
```

✔ Use parentheses for clarity.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Using Parentheses (Best Practice)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Students
WHERE (Marks > 60 AND Marks < 90)
   OR StudentID = 1;
GO
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Common Operator Mistakes

❌ Using `=` instead of `IS NULL`
❌ Forgetting parentheses
❌ Misusing AND / OR
❌ NOT IN with NULL values
❌ Using LIKE incorrectly
